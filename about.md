Hey there.

I'm Tony Yu, a backend and Android developer. My specializations are in
network systems, and I'm strongly interested in Internet of Things. Things that strengthen connections
excites me, and there must be a network that will transcend all social networks/platforms we have
and will alter our perception of the world.

Personally I like classical music, and Karajan and Seiji Ozawa are my favorite conductors. I'm not
officially a fan of any singer, but [Eason Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eason_Chan)'s songs
populate my playlist.

This blog is not purely a tech blog. I mostly post programming stuff but sometimes there can be articles about
rather daily stuff.
