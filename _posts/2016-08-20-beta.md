## Why having this blog

> When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will
select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid
them.
>
> Confucius, *The Analects* Book VII, Chapter 21

Years ago I had this site [skyfarm.com.cn](http://www.skyfarm.com.cn) as a
personal blog. Unfortunately things got busy and I didn't maintain
it. But a while ago I felt this urge to share what I've seen or learned
in development, and a blog seems a good place to start.

I wish this blog will ultimately benefit someone who encounters the same
problems, or is simply trying to find ideas or to make certain implementation decisions. At
the same time it will establish a way to connect with many other
great developers out there and to exchange views on emerging technologies.
Therefore I'll monitor the comments and try to reply as promptly as possible.


## What's next

The next will be the implementation of a message queue library called Ring made when I was
an intern at [Douban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douban).
It is now open-source per the platform team's decision, and its public, alpha version is
[on my GitHub](https://github.com/mar29th/ring).
It will be moved to the company's organization account when it goes to beta or stable.
